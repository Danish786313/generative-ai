LangChain:
    ➤ LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models
    ➤ Very popular lately - for Python and TypeScript
    ➤ Build small apps
    ➤ Integrate it with external data sources and vector DBs (Chroma DB)

What is LangChain?
➤ Framework for building LLM based applications
    ➤ Fairly new, very popular
➤ LangChain Libraries:
    ➤ Interfaces and integrations for components
➤ Implement abstractions:
    ➤ Chains - chain commands
    ➤ Agents - use an LLM to make decisions

Retrieval-Augmented Generation

    ➤ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the 
       output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative 
       knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating 
       a response
    ➤ RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific 
       domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the 
       need to retrain the model
