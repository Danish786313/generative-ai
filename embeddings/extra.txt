Embeddings:
    ➤ What they are and why we need them
    ➤ Change gears: more "geeky" section
    ➤ OpenAl embeddings
    ➤ Similarity
    ➤ Project: movie recommendation system

concepts:
    embedding
    similarities
    dot product
    cosine similarities

Embeddings - [0.2, 0.123, 0, -0.4, 1]
    ➤ The key to Al
    ➤ Numerical representation of data: text, images, sound
    ➤ Text embedding - numerical representation of text
    ➤ Take the form of numbers array (vector)
    ➤ Embedding (latent) space - a space in which similar items are positioned 
	   closer to one another than less similar items
       [0.2, 0.123, 0, -0.4, 1]



Embedding models
    ➤ Def: set of algorithms trained to generate embeddings
    ➤ OpenAl:
        ➤ text-embedding-3-small
        ➤ text-embedding-3-large
        ➤ text-embedding-ada-002 (old)
     ➤ Others:
        - UAE-Large-V1
        - bge-base-en-v1.5
    ➤ Why we need embeddings: similarity search
        ➤ Recommendation systems
        ➤ Basic chat functionality

Assignment:
Movie recommender project
    ➤ List of movie titles with descriptions input
    ➤ The user inputs some preferences about movies
    ➤ The system will recommend some movies
