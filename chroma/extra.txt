Embeddings app
    ➤ Vector DB:
    ➤ Store embeddings
➤ Query based on embeddings - similarity search
    ➤ Query > most relevant result
    ➤ Context injection - provide OpenAl with relevant context for a question and use it

Chat with your data app structure:
    ➤ Starting point: relevant info about a private topic
    ➤ Break the data into chucks
    - Store thern (with embeddings) inside a vector DB
    ➤ Ask a question - DB query
    ➤ Use similarity search to find the most relevant chunk
    ➤ Use OpenAl to properly answer the question
